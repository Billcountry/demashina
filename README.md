#### (Delivery Mashinani)

This is an online delivery service that tries to solve Kenya's very complicated home addressing system.
In Kenya it's easy to locate an office in a specific building in the city but when it comes to door to door delivery the issue changes.
This is an un-explored area that can be very useful if there was a way to map the whole nation with home and office addresses instead of P.O. Boxes

We can provide a platform to map these areas and then provide an online store that can deliver to the door step with a guarantee.
When our customer signs up we send an agent to map their location, once that's done deliveries to the location can always be to the door.
We can partner with landlords to map rental houses among other places. 

When we have mapped our locations. Partnering with businesses and individuals providing various goods and delivering them to their customers.
We can provide online stores to the business through our website or they can integrate our services to their website through our api.
Businesses can then pay us for the delivery.

Businesses would also have a choice of how far from their location that they want to deliver, the urgency for delivery, e.t.c

For our courier services they would be easier if we were to partner with the already existing echo system.
Partnering with bus companies, and even bodaboda people for an easier door to door reach.(More like uber).

Profits would be from the businesses paying us to deliver and us ensuring that the cost of delivery is cheaper.
We would be like a shopping website but selling and delivering other peoples products.
With good mapping delivery of items like groceries would be possible since in a populated area people buying small things and us delivering in bulk would be cheap.
This would bring an amazon like shopping experience to kenya. 
Someone can order a bottle of lotion and still get it at their doorstep at minimal price.
